                ➢ In ancient time, according to the researches carried on our religious books and 
                scriptures, the Indian philosophers stated that matter is made from five constituents or 
                tatvas.
                FIVE TATVAS
                Air
                (Vayu)
                Earth
                (Prithvi)
                Water
                (Jal)
                Fire
                (Agni)
                Sky
                (Aakash)
                Modern scientists have evolved two types of classification of matte
                <br><br>
                MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES 
                ➢ Now that we have defined matter let us ask ourselves the question – What is matter 
                made up of?
                ➢ All matter comprises of very small particles. 
                ➢ All matter can be broken up in a similar manner to get very small particles. 
                ➢ Hence we now conclude that all matter is made up of small particles. 
                <br><br>
                PROPERTIES OF MATTER
                All matter consists of small particles of matter. These particles have some common 
                characteristics. These characteristics are laid down in a theory called Kinetic Theory of 
                Matter.
                Stated very simply The Kinetic Theory of Matter States 
                ➢ All matter comprises of small particles.
                ➢ These particles have space in between them. 
                ➢ The particles are continuously moving. 
                ➢ The particles attract each other. 
                <br>
                PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE BETWEEN THEM
                ➢ Matter is made up of small particles. 
                ➢ These particles have small spaces between them.
                ➢ These spaces are invisible to the naked eye. 
                ➢ But particles of other matter can get between these spaces without increase in volume.
                <br> 
                PARTICLES OF MATTER ARE CONTINUOUSLY MOVING 
                ➢ Particles present in matter move continuously.
                ➢ The particles of matter shown three types of motion. 
                ➢ Translatory Motion – When particles move in straight lines, changing direction 
                without loss of energy on colliding with another particle or the wall of the container, 
                the motion is called translatory motion. Translatory motion is maximum in gases and 
                the least in solids when compared to liquids.</p>
